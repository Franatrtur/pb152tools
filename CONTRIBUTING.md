## Advisor Tool

The `advisor` tool is a work in progress. It is intended to provide advice on how to improve your C code.

The advisor tool works by analyzing your C code and comparing it to a set of best practices. It will then provide you with a set of recommendations on how to improve your code.

The advisor tool is still in beta, so it may not be able to provide recommendations for all types of C code. We are actively working on improving the advisor tool, and we welcome your feedback.

## How to Contribute

If you would like to contribute to the advisor tool, please fork the repository and submit a pull request.

We are looking for contributions in the following areas:

*   Improving the accuracy of the recommendations
*   Adding new recommendations
*   Improving the user interface

If you have any questions, please feel free to open an issue on GitHub.
